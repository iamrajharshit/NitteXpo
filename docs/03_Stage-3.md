# Deployment On Edge using GRADIO
After collaboratively training the model through incremental learning, sharing updates with a central server. Ultimately, we'll deploy the refined model on one of these edge devices, a laptop in this case, and use Gradio for a user-friendly inference interface.

**Note:** This is a demo video, and the deployed model may not produce accurate inferences at this stage.
